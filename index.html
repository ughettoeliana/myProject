      <h2>What are organic products?</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years there has been a growing concern to know how and what we
        eat and how this affects our health. It is a growing trend in which
        restaurants, supermarkets and producers have modified the way in which
        they offer, consume and generate vegetables, vegetables, dairy products
        and meats.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And despite being a trend in which products are a little more expensive
        than conventional ones, many people are choosing this lifestyle. Learn a
        little more about what organic products are.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Organic products are often confused with natural ones. Natural foods are
        those that are free of artificial ingredients or additives and are as
        less processed as possible and generally do not need certification.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For their part, organic products are those that have been grown without
        artificial pesticides, fertilizers or herbicides. It must be produced in
        the midst of cultural, biological and mechanical practices that
        contribute to sustainability and conserve biodiversity, that is, that
        its processes do not affect the soils or the health of those who work on
        its crops.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For the cultivation of vegetables, greens and fruits, processes such as
        synthetic fertilizers, irradiation and genetic alteration are not
        allowed. As for meat animals for consumption such as cows, pigs,
        chickens and chickens, they are fed on fertilizer-free soils and grains
        and they do not receive hormones or drugs that promote their growth in
        an accelerated way, since genetically modified organisms they cannot be
        marketed either.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For a product to be considered organic, its entire process must be
        certified and must contain a label that indicates that it is grown under
        optimal conditions to be accredited as such. Some of them are 100%
        organic, meaning that they do not contain any non-organic ingredients or
        processes.
